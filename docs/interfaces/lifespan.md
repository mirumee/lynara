# Lifespan

Lynara handles the lifespan protocol of ASGI with it's LifespanInterface. LifespanInterface while being an interface it's quite different from the HTTPInterfaces both in it's role and behavior.

The `Lynara.run` utility allows to specify which lifespan mode should be used

```python
from lynara import LifespanMode, Lynara

lynara = Lynara(app=django_asgi_app, lifespan_mode=LifespanMode.AUTO)
```

There are 3 modes:

- `OFF` - the lifespan interface will not be used at all
- `ON` - the lifespan interface will be used, if the application fails to handle it, it will error out
- `AUTO` - similar to ON, but will not fail if the application does not handle lifespans
